Description:  This is a text-based game where the player competes against the computer in a game of Stone, Paper, Scissors(You may have played in your childhood).
Pseudocode:
1. For the start of games I will display a welcome message to the player.
2. Give the basics instruction to the player to enter their choice from the available options: Stone, Paper, Scissors, or to exit the game.
3. If the player chooses to exit, I will display a exit message and end the game or the code execution stops.
4. If the player's choice is not one of the valid options, I will display an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
5. Convert the player's choice to an integer index (0 for Stone, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors by indexing and storing the possible outcomes in an array).
6. Generate a random choice for the computer (0 for Stone, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors by using "random" keyword and creating a method).
7. Then will display the choices made by the player and the computer. 
8. Then Comparing the choices to determine the winner:
9. I will use if, elif or may be else conditional statements to handle all the possible result.
10. If the choices are the same, it's a tie.
11. If the player wins according to the rules of the game (Stone crushes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, Paper covers Stone), display a victory message.
12. Otherwise, the computer wins, so display a message indicating this.
13. Will repeat the game loop until the player chooses to exit.
